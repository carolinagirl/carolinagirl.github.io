    <h1>LeighAnn Brown</h1>
    <p>I have a Bachelor's of Art degree with a concentration in Graphic Design.
      I have worked in this field for more than 15 years. I worked mostly with
      print design, designing magazine layout, books, conference materials, flyers, etc.
      I've always wanted to learn web design and took a few classes early on in my career.
      Now I'm ready to learn all I can about web develop and design.</p>
